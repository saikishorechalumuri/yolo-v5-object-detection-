# yolo Version v5 Object Detection 

This project is a pretrained Object detection project.Which takes an input data of images and vedios and Break them into vectors  using yolo v5 network and create a object detected output Result

This Project is to detect the object locally in Conda environment, with help of Pre trained Data sets Using Yolo version V5 network 

This project is Trained Under Predetermined coco-data Set

## How to Run The yolo v5 


##STEPS

-Install all the softwares in Acknowldgement
-In the Acknowldgement section you will have repository download the 
repository in to your system 



specfic commands mentioned below should be executed once all the steps are done :


1)git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
(if cloning is problem download manually and specify the path in the conda env)


2)cd yolov5

3)pip install -r requirements.txt  # install 

This third command will install all the requirements of yolo v5 into requirements.txt 



Note:If you miss any of the Acknowldgement Steps It  will show an error  

## Executing step

Use the following command and execute it u can see the output in the 
folder runs folder 

* I also attached the vedio ouputs in output section
* you can add coustimzed vedios and place in the specfic folder 
  and make sure the path must be correct when you are running in Conda Environment
